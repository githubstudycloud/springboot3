# Platform Architecture Design Decisions

## Introduction

This document outlines the key architectural decisions made during the design of the platform microservices architecture. It explains the rationale behind these decisions and discusses their implications.

## Architectural Style

### Decision: Microservices Architecture

We've adopted a microservices architecture for the platform for the following reasons:

1. **Scalability**: Each service can be scaled independently based on its specific load characteristics.
2. **Technology Flexibility**: Different services can use different technologies when appropriate.
3. **Resilience**: Failure in one service doesn't bring down the entire system.
4. **Team Organization**: Teams can own and develop services independently.
5. **Deployment Flexibility**: Services can be deployed, updated, and rolled back independently.

### Implications

- Increased operational complexity
- Need for robust service discovery and configuration management
- Distributed transaction challenges
- Increased network communication

## Service Decomposition

### Decision: Domain-Driven Decomposition

Services are decomposed based on business domains and capabilities rather than technical functions:

1. **Business Domains**:
   - Data collection
   - Core processing
   - Business analytics
   - System monitoring
   - Task scheduling

2. **Scheduler Domain Decomposition**:
   - Split into registration, execution, and query services
   - Each with distinct responsibilities and scaling needs

### Implications

- Clearer boundaries between services
- Reduced coupling between domains
- Potential for duplicated functionality
- Need for well-defined interfaces

## Data Management

### Decision: Database per Service with Event Synchronization

Each service manages its own data, with event-based synchronization for shared data:

1. **Private Databases**: Each service has its own database
2. **Event Publishing**: Services publish events when data changes
3. **Event Subscription**: Services subscribe to events to update local representations

### Implications

- Data consistency challenges
- Need for robust event handling
- Simplified data schema per service
- Improved scalability
- More complex query patterns for cross-service data

## Communication Patterns

### Decision: Mixed Communication Styles

We've adopted a mix of communication patterns based on specific needs:

1. **Synchronous Communication (REST)**:
   - User-facing requests requiring immediate responses
   - Critical system operations

2. **Asynchronous Communication (Message Queue)**:
   - Background processing
   - Long-running operations
   - Event notifications
   - Task scheduling

3. **Service Mesh**:
   - For managing service-to-service communication
   - Traffic routing and load balancing
   - Circuit breaking and retry logic

### Implications

- More complex overall system
- Improved resilience with asynchronous operations
- Need for message idempotency
- Need for correlation IDs for tracing

## API Gateway

### Decision: Centralized API Gateway

We've adopted a centralized API Gateway approach:

1. **Single Entry Point**: All client requests go through the gateway
2. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**:
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Rate limiting
   - Request/response logging
   - Response caching
   - Request routing
3. **Canary Deployment Support**: Gradual rollout of new service versions

### Implications

- Potential single point of failure (mitigated by load balancing)
- Centralized policy enforcement
- Simplified client integration
- Need for high performance and low latency

## Service Discovery

### Decision: Client-Side Discovery with Registry

We've adopted client-side service discovery with a service registry:

1. **Service Registry (Eureka)**: Services register themselves with the registry
2. **Client-Side Discovery**: Clients query the registry to find service instances
3. **Health Checking**: Registry monitors service health

### Implications

- Simplified service deployment
- Dynamic scaling
- More complex client configuration
- Need for client-side load balancing

## Configuration Management

### Decision: Centralized Configuration Server

We've adopted a centralized configuration management approach:

1. **Config Server**: Spring Cloud Config Server
2. **Environment-Specific Configs**: Different configurations for dev, test, prod
3. **Runtime Reconfiguration**: Support for dynamic configuration updates

### Implications

- Centralized configuration management
- Version-controlled configurations
- Runtime configuration updates
- Need for robust security

## Resilience Patterns

### Decision: Circuit Breaker and Resource Monitoring

We've implemented multiple resilience patterns:

1. **Circuit Breaker**: Prevent cascading failures
2. **Retry**: Automatic retry for transient failures
3. **Timeout**: Prevent hanging operations
4. **Bulkhead**: Isolate failures
5. **Resource Monitoring**: Self-protection against overloads

### Implications

- Improved system stability
- More complex service implementation
- Need for proper timeout configuration
- Need for comprehensive monitoring

## Monitoring and Observability

### Decision: Comprehensive Observability Stack

We've implemented a comprehensive observability approach:

1. **Logging**: Centralized logging with structured log format
2. **Metrics**: Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization
3. **Tracing**: Distributed tracing with Zipkin
4. **Health Monitoring**: Spring Boot Actuator and Admin

### Implications

- Improved system visibility
- Quicker problem detection and resolution
- Additional infrastructure requirements
- Need for consistent monitoring practices

## Security

### Decision: Token-Based Authentication with Fine-Grained Authorization

We've adopted a token-based security model:

1. **JWT Tokens**: For authentication
2. **Role-Based Access Control**: For authorization
3. **API Gateway Security**: Centralized security enforcement
4. **Service-to-Service Security**: Mutual TLS

### Implications

- Simplified authentication flow
- Stateless authentication
- Need for token validation
- Need for secure token storage

## Deployment Strategy

### Decision: Containerization with Kubernetes

We've adopted containerization and orchestration:

1. **Docker**: For service containerization
2. **Kubernetes**: For container orchestration
3. **Helm Charts**: For deployment management
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**: For automated deployment

### Implications

- Consistent deployment environment
- Simplified scaling
- Complex infrastructure
- Need for container expertise

## Conclusion

The architectural decisions outlined in this document form the foundation of our platform's design. These decisions are based on industry best practices, our specific requirements, and the need for a scalable, resilient, and maintainable system.

As the system evolves, these decisions should be periodically reviewed and adjusted based on changing requirements and lessons learned during implementation and operation.
