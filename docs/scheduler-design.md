# Platform Scheduler System Design

## Overview

The Platform Scheduler System is responsible for handling all scheduled tasks across the platform. It follows a microservices architecture pattern, with the scheduling functionality split into three separate services:

1. **platform-scheduler**: The core scheduler service that manages task execution
2. **platform-scheduler-register**: Service for registering and managing scheduled tasks
3. **platform-scheduler-query**: Service for querying task status and history

This design ensures separation of concerns and allows each component to scale independently based on its specific load characteristics.

### Data Flow

1. Tasks are registered via the platform-scheduler-register service
2. Registration information is stored in the database
3. The platform-scheduler service periodically polls for tasks that need to be executed
4. When tasks are triggered, they are sent to a message queue
5. Task execution workers consume from the queue and perform the actual work
6. Task status updates are sent back to the platform-scheduler service
7. The platform-scheduler-query service provides endpoints for querying task status and history

## Database Schema

### Tasks Table
```
CREATE TABLE scheduler_tasks (
    id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    cron_expression VARCHAR(100),
    task_class VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    task_data TEXT,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    priority INT DEFAULT 5,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    created_by VARCHAR(100),
    retry_count INT DEFAULT 0,
    max_retry_count INT DEFAULT 3,
    last_executed_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    next_execution_time TIMESTAMP NULL,
    timeout_seconds INT DEFAULT 3600
);
```

### Task Execution History Table
```
CREATE TABLE task_execution_history (
    id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
    task_id VARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
    start_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    end_time TIMESTAMP NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,

## API Endpoints

### Platform Scheduler Register Service

#### Register a new task
```
POST /api/v1/tasks
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Daily Data Cleanup",
  "description": "Removes temporary data older than 7 days",
  "cronExpression": "0 0 0 * * ?",
  "taskClass": "com.platform.tasks.CleanupTask",
  "taskData": "{\"retentionDays\": 7, \"batchSize\": 1000}",
  "priority": 3,
  "maxRetryCount": 3,
  "timeoutSeconds": 1800
}
```

#### Update a task
```
PUT /api/v1/tasks/{taskId}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "description": "Removes temporary data older than 14 days",
  "cronExpression": "0 0 0 * * ?",
  "taskData": "{\"retentionDays\": 14, \"batchSize\": 1000}",
  "priority": 4,
  "maxRetryCount": 5
}
```

#### Delete a task
```
DELETE /api/v1/tasks/{taskId}
```

### Platform Scheduler Query Service

```

#### Get task execution metrics
```
GET /api/v1/tasks/{taskId}/metrics
```

## Self-Monitoring and Protection

The scheduler system implements several mechanisms to prevent overloading:

1. **Memory and CPU Monitoring**:
   - Monitors its own memory and CPU usage
   - Throttles task execution when resources are constrained
   - Can temporarily reject new tasks when under heavy load

2. **External Flow Control**:
   - Respects system-wide flow control indicators
   - Can be instructed to reduce throughput by external monitoring systems
   - Implements circuit breaker patterns for dependent services

3. **Adaptive Scheduling**:
   - Adjusts scheduling based on system load
   - Implements backoff mechanisms for repeated failures
   - Balances task execution across time to prevent spikes

## Deployment Considerations

1. **High Availability**:
   - Deploy multiple instances of each service
   - Use a load balancer to distribute requests
   - Implement proper failover mechanisms

2. **Scalability**:
   - Horizontal scaling of each service independently
   - Vertical scaling for the database when needed
   - Task worker scaling based on queue depth

3. **Monitoring and Alerting**:
   - Monitor task execution success rates
   - Alert on excessive failures or delays
   - Track resource utilization across all components

4. **Backup and Recovery**:
   - Regular database backups
   - Task execution recovery procedures
   - System state recovery mechanisms

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Scheduling Features**:
   - Calendar-based scheduling (e.g., business days only)
   - Event-driven task triggering
   - Task dependencies and workflows

2. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Task batching for improved throughput
   - Predictive scaling based on historical patterns
   - Query optimization for large task histories

3. **User Interface**:
   - Task management dashboard
   - Visual schedule editor
   - Execution history visualization

4. **Integration Capabilities**:
   - Webhook support for external systems
   - API expansion for third-party integration
   - Extended notification options
